    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <h3>No Code bloat</h3>

      <p>RACK:APP is completely monkey patch free! No Core Class magic, main space method bloats or universal global helpers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <h3>Absolute minimal runtime processing</h3>

      <p>RACK:APP preprocesses anything that it can! This achieve minimal overhead during request processing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <h3>Easy to Learn</h3>

      <p>Mastering RACK:APP takes very little time! It's DSL was inspired by Sinatra.</p>

      <p>The framework is a bit opinionated, but all you need is your classic ruby method listing trick:</p>

      <code>puts(self.methods - Object.methods)</code>

      <p>Everything is self descriptive. If not, drop us a mail to make it so!</p>

      <h3>Principle Of Least Surprise</h3>

      <p>RACK:APP is simple! Everything works just as you would expect it to. No black magic correcting developers' mistakes at runtime.</p>

      <p>If something should break during development, it will.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <h3>Modular design</h3>

      <p>RACK:APP does not force you to use the full development stack! Start with the Core and add modules as needed.</p>
      <p>Writing plugins and isolated mountable applications is also a piece of cake.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <h3>One dependency to rule them all</h3>

      <p>"RACK:APP has a single dependency, called rack!" - Captain Obvious</p>
      <p>Disclaimer: you do need a webserver to run your app :)</p>
