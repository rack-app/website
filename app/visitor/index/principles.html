    <div class="row">
      <h3>Keep It Simple</h3>

      <p>We try to keep code base at the bare minimum while still offer high productivity</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <h3>No Code bloat</h3>

      <p>No monkey patch, or anything that touch the Core Classes, no main space method bloats, or universal global helpers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <h3>Bare minimum run time processing</h3>

      <p>The framework it self try to preprocess anything that could be, to achieve minimal processing during request</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <h3>Fully BDD</h3>

      <p>For creating production ready code, we require tdd, and for that, the framework made in mind with Behaviour Driven Design</p>
      <p>You can create integration test with only be require the Test module in your specification.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <h3>Easy to Learn</h3>

      <p>Before we started to build this framework, we had the chance to use a lot of more or less popular framework,
        and the Sinatra DSL was one of the inspiration to go with in terms of DSL use.</p>

      <p>While this is a choose in term of taste, the whole framework could be easily understand,
        all you need is your classic ruby method listing trick:</p>

      <code>puts(self.methods - Object.methods)</code>

      <p>Everything should be self describing. If not please do not hesitate tell us about your opinion</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <h3>Principle Of Least Surprise</h3>

      <p>Simply as it is. Everything works just as how it is specified,
        no black magic included to correct even the developers mistake.</p>

      <p>If something should came out during development, it will.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <h3>Modular design</h3>

      <p>As long you don't need something other than the core features, you are not forced to use a full development stack.</p>
      <p>But you can easily extend the feature set then you require.</p>
      <p>Writing plugins and isolated mountable applications is also cup cake</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <h3>Only dependency to rule them all</h3>

      <p>Other than a webserver, all you need is rack, nothing more, to start create web applications</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <h3>Open development</h3>

      <p>You can contribute to the project on Github anytime you want, even ideas are welcome.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <h3>Learning through</h3>

      <p>We Try to create Example Codes for every feature so it can be easily learned</p>
    </div>
